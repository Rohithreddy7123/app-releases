# Installing Threat Model Reviewer

Threat Model Reviewer is a **Windows desktop application**. Three download options are
attached to every release on the
**[releases page](https://github.com/Rohithreddy7123/app-releases/releases)** — pick one.

## System requirements

- **Windows 10 (1809 / build 17763) or Windows 11**, 64-bit (x64).
- ~400 MB free disk space.
- **No .NET install needed** — every download is self-contained (the .NET runtime is bundled).
- **Optional:** a **GitHub Copilot** subscription, only if you want the AI features. The
  app uses your signed-in seat; the deterministic review works fully offline without it.

## Option 1 — MSI installer — *recommended*

1. Download `ThreatModelReviewer-vX.Y.Z-x64.msi`.
2. Run it. The wizard lets you choose **"Install for all users"** (per-machine, into
   Program Files — needs admin once) or **"Install just for me"** (per-user, into your
   profile — no admin). It adds a Start-Menu shortcut and an entry in *Apps & features*.
3. If **SmartScreen** warns (see [About the SmartScreen warning](#about-the-smartscreen-warning)),
   click **More info → Run anyway**.

## Option 2 — Portable (zip)

1. Download `ThreatModelReviewer-vX.Y.Z-win-x64-portable.zip`.
2. Right-click → **Properties** → tick **Unblock**, then **Extract All** to a folder you
   control (e.g. `C:\Apps\ThreatModelReviewer`).
3. Run **`ThreatModelReviewer.exe`**.

> Keep the files together — `ThreatModelReviewer.exe` needs the folder beside it
> (including `runtimes\win-x64\native\copilot.exe`, which powers the Copilot features).

## Option 3 — Inno Setup installer (`Setup.exe`)

A per-user installer (no admin). Download `…-setup.exe` and run it. An alternative to the
MSI if you prefer a single per-user `.exe`.

## Option 4 — MSIX package — *experimental*

The MSIX is signed with a **self-signed** certificate, so you must trust it first:

1. Download `…-x64.msix` **and** `ThreatModelReviewer-publisher.cer`.
2. Right-click `…-publisher.cer` → **Install Certificate** → **Local Machine** →
   **Place all certificates in the following store** → **Trusted People** → Finish.
   *(needs admin)*
3. Double-click the `.msix` and **Install**.

> **Heads-up:** under MSIX the app runs in a packaged container. The Copilot SDK spawns a
> CLI child process and makes network calls, which can hit container restrictions — so
> **AI features may be limited under MSIX**. For full Copilot support, prefer the **MSI**
> or **portable** options.

## About the SmartScreen warning

The downloads are **Authenticode-signed**, but with a **self-signed** certificate for now —
so Microsoft Defender SmartScreen may still show *"Windows protected your PC"* on first run.
That's expected; click **More info → Run anyway**. The app is safe (the source is reviewed
and the deterministic engine runs locally).

SmartScreen only stops warning when the binaries are signed with a certificate from a
**trusted Certificate Authority** (ideally **EV**, or **Azure Trusted Signing**). That
requires identity enrollment + a small cost, so it's planned rather than shipped. Once a CA
certificate is in place, the warning disappears for everyone — no change needed on your end.

## Signing in to GitHub Copilot (optional)

The first time you use an AI feature, the app uses your **GitHub Copilot** seat:

- If you're already signed in to Copilot on this machine (e.g. via the GitHub CLI or an
  IDE), it's picked up automatically.
- Otherwise, follow the in-app prompt to sign in.
- Prefer not to use Copilot? Open **AI provider** in the header to point at an
  OpenAI-compatible endpoint (Azure OpenAI / OpenAI / local), or just don't use the AI
  buttons — the verdict, score, and findings are computed deterministically without AI.

## Uninstalling

- **MSI / Inno installer:** *Settings → Apps → Threat Model Reviewer → Uninstall*.
- **Portable:** delete the folder.
- **MSIX:** right-click the Start-Menu tile → **Uninstall**.
